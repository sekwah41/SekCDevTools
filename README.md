SekCDevTools
============
This is just a mod to make small utilities for while I dev. Though I may add some tools that dont belong in sekclib.

The quick loading for the world can be done via --quickPlaySingleplayer (world) now natively in minecraft.

Though I will keep this as I reset the run configs often.
